/**
 * The provenance section: what the audit sidecar buys you, shown rather than claimed.
 *
 * The app's real AuditViewer reads a sidecar over Tauri IPC, so it cannot run on a
 * static site. This is a self-contained retelling built from base components with
 * hardcoded rows, labelled as an example so nobody mistakes it for their own data.
 *
 * A Server Component on purpose — no "use client". Nothing here holds state, listens
 * for an event or reaches for an effect: the table's horizontal scroll is the
 * browser's, not ours. The classification meanings are the whole payload of the
 * section, and meaning that only appears on hover is meaning a phone never shows, so
 * they are printed as text instead of hidden behind a Tooltip.
