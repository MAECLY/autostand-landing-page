 * A Client Component: the Accordion is Radix, and a panel that cannot open is
 * worse than no panel at all. Next has no `client:visible` equivalent — the
 * directive is the whole declaration — but the trade is the same either way,
 * since the markup is still server-rendered and only the behaviour is shipped.

    answer: (
      <>
        Claude, Ollama, OpenAI/Codex, Gemini and Grok. Each one runs the local CLI first and falls
        back to that vendor's HTTP API, and you pick the default in Settings.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "cost",
    question: "Do I need a subscription or an API key?",
    answer: (
      <>
        One of the two, not both. If you are already signed in to a provider's CLI, autostand
        reuses that session and never handles a key; otherwise it uses an API key you store in your
        OS keychain. Ollama runs on your own machine, so it needs neither.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "sources",
    question: "What does it read?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Your local git history, your GitHub activity through the <Code>gh</Code> CLI, and your
        Claude Code, Remember, opencode, Codex, Gemini CLI and Grok CLI sessions. Every source is
        read-only. The only files autostand writes are your standup and its own local state.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "network",
    question: "Does anything get sent to a server?",
    answer: (
      <>
        There is no autostand server, no account and no telemetry. The only outbound traffic is the
        request to the AI provider you configured — none at all if you render with Ollama or the
        deterministic renderer — plus <Code>git push</Code> and the <Code>gh</Code> CLI talking to
        GitHub with your own credentials. Gathering, scrubbing, writing and the audit trail all
        happen on your machine.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "no-provider",
    question: "What happens when no AI provider is available?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A deterministic renderer is built into the pipeline, so a standup is written straight from
        your facts with no model involved. If the provider is missing, times out, or returns
        something the validator rejects, that render is what lands in the file. The audit sidecar
        records that it fell back.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "two-machines",
    question: "I work on two machines. Do they fight over the file?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. Each machine owns its own AUTO block, keyed by a stable host slug, so two machines
        write to different regions of the same dated file. The dailies repo marks those files{" "}
        <Code>merge=union</Code>, so git concatenates both sides instead of raising a conflict.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    id: "manual-notes",
    question: "Will it edit the notes I wrote myself?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Never. Anything between the MANUAL markers is yours, and a compile only replaces its own
        AUTO block. Bullets from an earlier run that the new render missed are put back —
        accumulate adds, it never deletes.
      </>

  {
    id: "install",
    question: "How do I get it today?",

      <>
        Build it from source: clone{" "}
        <a className={linkClass} href={REPO_URL}>
          the repo
        </a>
        , then <Code>pnpm install</Code> and <Code>pnpm tauri dev</Code>. No installer is published
        yet, so that is the only way to run it. You will need Rust, Node 20+ and pnpm 9+.
